So, our app is called Noted, and what we're basically trying to design is an app that can take disorganized, chaotic, filler-word-filled speech and convert it into a coherent, streamlined and exciting prompt, notes, pitch, so that I can convey the ideas that I have in a proper and effective way to people outside. For example, if I'm taking notes on something, or I'm writing about an app, or looking at features, functionality and stuff, I'll be able to record my thoughts, like I'm doing right now, and the app will give me notes on the specific details of my thoughts, a summary, insights, as well as provide me a concise pitch on what I can do to present my ideas.
