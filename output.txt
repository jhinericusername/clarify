I have provided a transcript of raw audio conversation that is disorganized. Write three sections, where the first section is a summary what the people in the audio conversation are talking about, the second section is a list of bullet points of notes on the conversation, and the third section takes the summary of the conversation and creates a 2 minute pitch for them.
